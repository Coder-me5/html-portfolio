 <h2>My all time best three movies.</h2>
 <hr/>

 <h3>The Pursuit of Happyness.</h3>
    <p>This is the best movie very often I watch. It gives your vision a taste of life. 
        The Pursuit of Happyness is a book and movie about a struggling salesman who overcomes 
        adversity to provide for his son. The story is about resilience, determination, 
        and the human spirit</p>
 <h3>Schindler's List.</h3>
    <p>This movie is my all time favourite movie. The Schindler's List is a historical drama 
    film about a German industrialist who saved Jewish people from the Holocaust during 
    World War II. The film is based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, 
    a Czech-born businessman who saved over 1,100 Jews.</p>
 <h3>Kashmir Files.</h3>
    <p>The Kashmir Files is a 2022 Hindi-language Bollywood drama film that depicts 
        the 1990 exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from Indian-administered Kashmir. 
        The film is a fictionalized account of the events leading up to the exodus and 
        the exodus itself</p>
